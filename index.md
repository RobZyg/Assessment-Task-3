ENFJ

Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging ENFJs are the benevolent 'pedagogues' of humanity. They have tremendous charisma by which many are drawn into their nurturant tutelage and/or grand schemes. Many ENFJs have tremendous power to manipulate others with their phenomenal interpersonal skills and unique salesmanship. But it's usually not meant as manipulation -- ENFJs generally believe in their dreams, and see themselves as helpers and enablers, which they usually are.

Results of the Myer-Briggs test:
personality type is: Consul
- 76% extraverted
- 61% observant
- 61% feeling
- 61% tactics
- 53% assertive

Results of the Learning styles test:
- Kinesthetic 69

Results of the TypeFinder Personality test
- 63% extraverted
- 51% intuition
- 55% feeling
- 60% judging

Personality code types: ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Provider’

What the results mean to me
The results show that as I tend to be more extraverted where I am energised by engaging with others and generally enjoy interacting with people. I also tend to be more feeling where I value empathy, cooperation and compassion. I also believe that everyone has a responsibility to take care of those around them. I believe that these traits are accurately portrayed. My learning style preference is learning by doing. I agree with that, whilst I believe passive learning such as watching a lecture and reading is important I think that the best way to test what I have learnt is by actually doing it or, where possible, testing the boundaries. For example instead of watching someone programming, which is helpful to understand the principles, actually programming and testing different things is more beneficial to me than watching.

Student ID:S3806967

I was born and grew up in Melbourne. My family lives across Melbourne and are mostly Australian. After finishing highschool I briefly attended Deakin University, studying a bachelor of arts. I deferred from the course after the second semester after realising I wanted to work fulltime rather than study. After working briefly in hospitality, I started working in finance for the National Australian Bank in 2017. Since then I have moved to a different company in a similar customer service role in Superannuation. Recently in May of 2019 I started studying a bachelor of business online with RMIT. When not working or studying, I enjoy playing tennis, reading, playing PC games and socialising. My main interest in IT stems from my childhood and job. Growing up I was always fascinated with how my family’s jobs were adapting based on the IT technology available. At work as well I rely strongly on a number of IT programs and platforms in order to deliver expected customer service and complex information to internal and external stakeholders. While I enjoy using these programs, I do not understand much beyond their surface level. I hope that this course will better educate me on how they function and how I can best use them going forward.

What do the results of the test mean to you?
While some of these test results are surprising, for the most part they mainly reinforce
what I already knew about myself. I have always been more of an introvert, and in
most large social situations have sought to isolate myself.

The Myer-Briggs test I felt was particularly accurate in that it defined many of my
personality traits and creative style. In This test I was ranked as an INFJ -T. The
test’s explanation of me as an advocate and Diplomat also helped me understand
more about myself and some of the things I have thought but struggled to word in the
past. Particularly, in that while I try my best to help others, I can also be sensitive to
others criticisms and thought, and too idealistic. The Myer-Briggs test also classified
me as easy to burn out, and always looking for a cause. These weaknesses identified
by the test resonated with me. In the past I have often avoided or put off routine
duties to focus fully on what I consider are concrete steps towards my goal. This has
led me on multiple occasions to burn out and give up on something I had been trying
to perfect.

The online learning test was the biggest surprise for me. I have never considered my
preferred style of learning, but before taking this test I would have guessed auditory. I
often enjoy listening to books and podcasts, rather than reading or watching lectures.
However the test classed me quite strongly as visual. I am not sure if I fully agree
with this assessment but will seek to identify my best learning strategies in the future
with experience.

The creativity test showed the most expected results, ranking me above average in
creativity. I have often been told growing up that I was quite creative, and this test
confirmed those comments. However, it was interesting to explore the sub categories
of creativity and where most people and myself ranked.

#### Ideal job

Complaints Manager
This position involves handling a large number of complaints that have been escalated beyond the contact centres in which they started. The successful applicant would need to investigate complex cases within a large organisation, often spanning across multiple divisions or departments. They would also have to correspond with the complainants to reach a positive resolution, while also working to adhere to financial and business rules and regulations. Additionally, they would affect long term change by identifying and seeking to change business practises to reduce dissatisfaction in the future. 

### Team profile

The diversity of backgrounds and personality types in this group make for a successful team as we can call on our different strengths to carry out the different tasks and assist other group members where needed. Together we bring together a wealth of experience and diverse knowledge. We have varied learning styles with some predominantly visual and other kinaesthetic learners, with plenty of opportunities to apply both learning styles during this project.
