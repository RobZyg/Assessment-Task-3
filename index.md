ENFJ

Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging ENFJs are the benevolent 'pedagogues' of humanity. They have tremendous charisma by which many are drawn into their nurturant tutelage and/or grand schemes. Many ENFJs have tremendous power to manipulate others with their phenomenal interpersonal skills and unique salesmanship. But it's usually not meant as manipulation -- ENFJs generally believe in their dreams, and see themselves as helpers and enablers, which they usually are.

Results of the Myer-Briggs test:
personality type is: Consul
- 76% extraverted
- 61% observant
- 61% feeling
- 61% tactics
- 53% assertive

Results of the Learning styles test:
- Kinesthetic 69
- Visual 51
- Auditory 49

Results of the TypeFinder Personality test
- 63% extraverted
- 51% intuition
- 55% feeling
- 60% judging

Personality code types: ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Provider’

What the results mean to me
The results show that as I tend to be more extraverted where I am energised by engaging with others and generally enjoy interacting with people. I also tend to be more feeling where I value empathy, cooperation and compassion. I also believe that everyone has a responsibility to take care of those around them. I believe that these traits are accurately portrayed. My learning style preference is learning by doing. I agree with that, whilst I believe passive learning such as watching a lecture and reading is important I think that the best way to test what I have learnt is by actually doing it or, where possible, testing the boundaries. For example instead of watching someone programming, which is helpful to understand the principles, actually programming and testing different things is more beneficial to me than watching.

### <a href="https://poddie62.github.io/RMIT/meandit">Tim</a> 

Student ID:S3806967

I was born and grew up in Melbourne. My family lives across Melbourne and are mostly Australian. After finishing highschool I briefly attended Deakin University, studying a bachelor of arts. I deferred from the course after the second semester after realising I wanted to work fulltime rather than study. After working briefly in hospitality, I started working in finance for the National Australian Bank in 2017. Since then I have moved to a different company in a similar customer service role in Superannuation. Recently in May of 2019 I started studying a bachelor of business online with RMIT. When not working or studying, I enjoy playing tennis, reading, playing PC games and socialising. My main interest in IT stems from my childhood and job. Growing up I was always fascinated with how my family’s jobs were adapting based on the IT technology available. At work as well I rely strongly on a number of IT programs and platforms in order to deliver expected customer service and complex information to internal and external stakeholders. While I enjoy using these programs, I do not understand much beyond their surface level. I hope that this course will better educate me on how they function and how I can best use them going forward.

#### Profile

What do the results of the test mean to you?
While some of these test results are surprising, for the most part they mainly reinforce
what I already knew about myself. I have always been more of an introvert, and in
most large social situations have sought to isolate myself.

The Myer-Briggs test I felt was particularly accurate in that it defined many of my
personality traits and creative style. In This test I was ranked as an INFJ -T. The
test’s explanation of me as an advocate and Diplomat also helped me understand
more about myself and some of the things I have thought but struggled to word in the
past. Particularly, in that while I try my best to help others, I can also be sensitive to
others criticisms and thought, and too idealistic. The Myer-Briggs test also classified
me as easy to burn out, and always looking for a cause. These weaknesses identified
by the test resonated with me. In the past I have often avoided or put off routine
duties to focus fully on what I consider are concrete steps towards my goal. This has
led me on multiple occasions to burn out and give up on something I had been trying
to perfect.

The online learning test was the biggest surprise for me. I have never considered my
preferred style of learning, but before taking this test I would have guessed auditory. I
often enjoy listening to books and podcasts, rather than reading or watching lectures.
However the test classed me quite strongly as visual. I am not sure if I fully agree
with this assessment but will seek to identify my best learning strategies in the future
with experience.

The creativity test showed the most expected results, ranking me above average in
creativity. I have often been told growing up that I was quite creative, and this test
confirmed those comments. However, it was interesting to explore the sub categories
of creativity and where most people and myself ranked.

#### Ideal job

Complaints Manager
This position involves handling a large number of complaints that have been escalated beyond the contact centres in which they started. The successful applicant would need to investigate complex cases within a large organisation, often spanning across multiple divisions or departments. They would also have to correspond with the complainants to reach a positive resolution, while also working to adhere to financial and business rules and regulations. Additionally, they would affect long term change by identifying and seeking to change business practises to reduce dissatisfaction in the future. 

### Team profile

The diversity of backgrounds and personality types in this group make for a successful team as we can call on our different strengths to carry out the different tasks and assist other group members where needed. Together we bring together a wealth of experience and diverse knowledge. We have varied learning styles with some predominantly visual and other kinaesthetic learners, with plenty of opportunities to apply both learning styles during this project.

### Group processes

In Assignment 2 we did all work well together towards the end and managed to pull the assignment together at the 11th hour, literally. We did have someone pull out without telling us, so we had to rally to do her part at the last minute, which meant that the assignment was not as polished as we would have liked. 

Based on our experiences with Assignment 2, we have established better channels for communications and document sharing and scheduled regular discussion times. We also started work earlier to ensure all parts were completed and contributions from different members have a consistent look and feel and are presented in a professional way.

### Career Plans

The career plans have remained static since the last assignment. Based on the segmented IT careers from the Burning Glass data the following was identified:

## 2.Project description

The overall goal of our team is to produce a product that can reduce road accidents in Australia. To do this, we have chosen to create an app called ClearDrive. This app will block notifications on mobile devices to reduce distracted driving. It is our hope, that by doing this we can reduce the use of phone will drive, while also raising awareness about the growing issue of distracted driving. 
In this document, we will outline exactly how we intend to build, launch and market ClearDrive into a viable product that can be downloaded by Australian drivers from all backgrounds and demographics. We will also address potential issues we anticipate with our product, and how we intend to stand out from any competing applications. 

## 3.Detailed description

### Motivation

Two previous team members had a very similar project, list of road toll stats, growing awareness and campaigns against texting while driving. Members of group felt strongly about this issue 

While all members of our team had previously heard of the dangers of distracted driving, few of us had any sort of investment in the issue. When we were initially brought together as a team for a past project however, Team member Robert discussed his proposed project for developing a technology that could prevent needless deaths due to distracted driving. Since then, our team has worked to develop ClearDrive’s plan into what it is today. 

However what first started off as a business idea soon became an issue that we all interested in being involved with. As our team did increasing research, it became clear the large impact distracted driving has on our community.  

A Victorian survey of 1,742 Victorians last year by the transport Accident Commission found that one third of drivers used their phones illegally while driving. In the past decade alone, over 700 people have died in motor accidents as a direct result of distracted driving. Many members of our team were surprised by the large toll that distracted driving had, and we further looked for ways to reduce it through our project.

### Landscape

As distracted driving has been an issue for some time, there already exist multiple competing apps that look to perform a similar function to clear drive in blocking notifications. However, our research indicates that when ClearDrive is complete it will have several important advantages over such competitors. 

As we explain further in our plan, our main Australian competitor is a product called TextStopper. While developed and currently available to be bought, TextStopper has various drawbacks that ClearDrive will take advantage of. Namely, TextStopper charges an installation fee, is not easily obtainable via digital download and is marketed towards companies rather than individuals. By comparison, ClearDrive will be free, easily downloadable off the app store and designed to appeal to all individuals with a car. These differences and more will be further explained in later parts of the plan. 

## 4.Aims

This project aims to reduce road accidents in Australia by creating an app that can reduce distractions emanating from mobile devices. This app will function in such a way that it will prevent mobile devices being used while driving, while also blocking all incoming notifications. By removing the potential to be distracted, it is our hope that our roads will become safer. To achieve this plan, we have broken it down into a number of achievable goals and steps which are listed below. 

  1.	Research and develop the needed software required to develop the application for general use 
  
  2.	Design the application to be simple and user friendly, with an interactive model that can appeal to all groups 
  
  3.	Plan a method to disseminate the app for public use across multiple mobile platforms 
  
  4.	Raise awareness and market the app to increase overall downloads and use while raising external support and investment
  
  5.	Work with relevant 3rd parties to develop incentives for using the app, as well as how to make use of potential legislation to increase its use. 

These five goals are the foundation of this project, and while they will undoubtedly change with time as the app develops, they offer a basic outline to its future progress. Further clarification and explanation on each goal can be found below. 

### 1.Research and development

Our first step in developing ClearDrive will be to conduct research into the most appropriate platforms to utilise when building it. It is imperative that the tool we select be easy to understand and usable by people with a limited background in app creation. The ideal tool would also have a function allowing multiple members of the team to work on it at once. As the platform we select will most likely be the same platform we develop in the future when our app becomes more complicated, it needs to be relatively advanced in what it allows, while also cost efficient. 

### 2.Interactive Design

If this project is to achieve our overarching aim of reducing road accidents in Australia, then this application will need to be accessible and useable by all demographics and groups. While it’s main purpose is served while not being interacted with, the app should be easy to turn on and off. It should reflect a Spartan yet modernistic design that is inoffensive and easy to understand. As our aim is to attract as many people as possible, the overall atheistic appeal is quite important. In our group discussions, many of use recounted apps used in the past that had been deleted due to their clunky and unappealing look, as much as for their usefulness. The design will also be imperative in helping us stand out from any competitors with a similar product. 

### 3.App Publication and dissemination

This goal focuses on uploading the app to the relevant online platforms that allow members of the public to download it and all necessary steps involved. It will also need to be formatted in such a way that it can be used on multiple popular platforms. For instance, when attempting to make this app available on iOS, we will need to follow the appropriate steps to use the iTunes store. These involve but are not limited to ensuring our app meets Apple Ssore’s guidelines, creating an Apple developer program account and uploading all needed code and metadata. 

### 4.Awareness and Marketing 

As previously mentioned, our aim depends on people downloading the app and using it. To do that, we require a strong marketing campaign that can raise awareness for what our project can offer the public. This campaign will have both traditional and digital marketing elements. Our crack marketing outreach team will first use digital methods to advertise online through the setting up of multiple social media accounts and a website. When we have the financial capability, we will also use more conventional methods to advertise such as billboards and radio commercials aimed at drivers. 

This goal also includes looking to secure external backers who would be interested in supporting or raising awareness for our project. These groups would vary from charitable organisations with similar aims as ours, to potentially government sponsored imitative which can financially cover our marketing costs. 

### 5.Breaking into mainstream use  

Our final and perhaps loftiest goal is to increase our apps use to such a rate in that we can work with major organisations to achieve long term use and popularity. This goal focuses on increasing the apps use from its initial breakout phase, and ensuring it maintains its use after it has been downloaded. This goal is hard to define as it is in our final step and will most likely change with time. However it could include reaching out to local legislators and working to see if this app could be involved in changes to laws regarding the use of phones will driving. Additionally, to keep users incentivised we could work with local and national businesses to develop a financial incentive program that can be used if a person is a regular user of the app. For example, this could be a small discount on petrol for a user who has consistently utilised the app while driving. 

## 5.Plans and progress

### The Plan

As our project is quite large, for the convenience of understanding it we have broken down our plan into multiple parts to make clear what our app will actually do, as well as elaborate on achieving our aims. 

#### What kind of software will we use?

As previously mentioned, the tool we select to build ClearDrive will need to meet a number of criteria for us to consider it. As many of us in the team do not come from IT backgrounds, and none of us have built an app before, it will need to have either have a clear instruction manual, or be simple to use. As the platform will also be used in the future to develop the app later into more complex functions. The original focus is to get the Minimum Viable Product out and use the Agile methodology to bring gradual additions and improvements to ClearDrive based on ongoing feedback. This rules out smaller, less tested tools, that do not have resource support or background documentation for larger projects. Finally, as building the app will be our first step and likely to be done without investment backing, the platform we choose will need to be cost effective for sustained use. Further specifics as to the software that will be used is discussed at 8.Tools and technologies, below.

#### What will the App look like when completed? 

It is highly likely that in time the app that we are developing will change in its function and design. But this section aims to clarify what our vision now would see our app realised as.

The app itself will be a free, downloadable piece of software that can be accessed through major platforms such as ITunes. It will be compatible with as many devices and software configurations as possible, giving us an expanded target market. We plan to bring it to both Android and iOS. 

While the app will serve a very large role when used, the ability of the user to interact with it is designed to be minimal. This is so we can prevent complicated menu options putting off the less techs savvy users, while also keeping the background code fairly simple. As previously mentioned in our aims, the visual design should revolve around a modernistic yes minimalistic feel, with a layout to impress upon users the reliability of the app. These goals will be achieved in a number of ways, including the use of darker mediums in colour design, and selective use of professional fonts. 

The app will have several options in its actual menu. These will allow the user to turn it on, turn it off, and edit its auto-detection software that assesses when a user is driving. Beyond that, a further section for adding the ability to auto reply to incoming messages will also be integrated into the apps menu.  

#### How will we launch this app for use? 

Further breakdown of aim - more detailed description and list of what needs to be done to put the app on IOS or other platforms and challenges faced.

After our app has been created, the next step is to host it on a platform from which user can download it. Ideally, our team would like to see this app brought to multiple platforms; however we plan to start with IOS. This means using the app store, a site containing over 2.2 million applications globally, and an excellent starting platform to launch from. 

In order for Apple and the app store to approve and support our app, there are a number of processes and steps that must be adhered to. 
Firstly, we must ensure that our app meets all Apple’s App store Guidelines. After examining the Guidelines (https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) the team anticipates no problems in this area, as our app is free of objectionable content, and does not infringe upon intellectual property. 

Next, our team must register for the Apple Developer program, which will allow us to upload the app while also giving us important information regarding analytics of the app, and providing access to Beta testing. Also needed to upload the app is an ITunes Connect Account. Largely used for management of apps already published, the account is a step mandated by Apple in order to upload to the app store. 

After we have completed all necessary steps to be able to upload, more information is needed around the advertisement and presentation of the app itself on the store. We will need to develop a visually appealing Icon, that stands out to people browsing the app store. Along with this, we will need a series of screenshots from the app, and a summary of what the app does. 

Once all necessary information has been supplied, the app will need to be uploaded to apple servers in preparation for its launch. We anticipate this being done on a platform such as Xcode or Application Loader, which are built partly for this purpose. Using these programs, our app’s code will be sent through our iTunes connect account to Apple servers. 

The final step of this process is to submit the app for review with Apple, which ensures that the app meets its guidelines and it suitable for the app store. The review process typically takes anywhere from 1-3 days, but once passed will enable us to release the app for public distribution. 

#### How will people learn about our app? 

When our app has been developed, and has been launched onto a viable platform, our next step will be working on a cohesive marketing campaign to attract users. 

As our target audience are all Australian drivers, our marketing techniques can vary enormously due to the multitude of demographics our market contains. 

Initially, we plan to use a series of online marketing techniques that are low cost, and can reach large numbers of people relatively easily. These involve establishing our app as a brand, and promoting it via the creation of social media sites on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, and creating a website using such resources as Github. 

There are several advantages of using online social media platforms as our initial point of advertising. Firstly, they appeal to our limited budget, and the costs of marketing or buying advertisements are upfront. According to marketing firm ThriveHub, the average cost per thousand views for Instagram in 2019, is $6.70 US. 

As such sites also collect extensive lists of demographic and geographic data; we can work to easily target our audience within these platforms. For example, we can steer away from the younger adult and teen demographics of ages 14 – 24, as statistically these age groups are far less likely to be driving than others. This will allow us to not expend limited resources advertising to audiences that cannot use our product. 

Overall, our team hopes to use a social media aspect and online presence to springboard our project into popularity. We hope that this popularity will see more app downloads and uses while we secure funding for more traditional forms of marketing. 

Texting while driving has gained considerable negative attention as time goes on, as awareness around its dangers has increased. This is has been largely due to governmental and charitable marketing campaigns, using platforms such as television advertisements. In 2013, the NSW government launched its ‘Get Your Hand Off IT’ campaign which was renewed in 2017. It involved a series of TV and radio advertisements to stop texting while driving. Since then, multiple other state governments have run similar initiatives, often working with small non-profit foundations. 

It is our hope that when we have established our product as a useful method to prevent texting while driving, and have started to attract users, we will be able to pitch to such organisations about working with us. This may include securing funding from certain governmental groups for marketing purposes, or even app expansion. 

When such funding is secured, we plan to turn our attention to alternative methods of advertising. These may include the implementation of billboards over major highways, or radio advertisements on channels frequented by drivers. While typically far more expensive, such marketing techniques have the potential to read thousands of new users for our app. 

#### What’s in our future? 

When our ClearDrive has been successfully developed, launched, and is being downloaded, our teams attention will turn to the future. Other than troubleshooting any problems or bugs and continuing marketing campaigns, we hope to be largely free to go in a number of directions. These future goals all largely aim as increasing App use, and working towards achieving our overall goal of safer roads. It is important to note that these ideas will most likely change with time, as our vision and methods of achieving our goals shift or change. 

As previously mentioned, distracted driving has become an increasingly large issue in Australia, and more and more steps are being made to bring it to the forefront of public awareness. As governments, charities and businesses all increase their spending and efforts to decrease distracted driving, it is our hope ClearDrive can make use of such campaigns. 

In 2015, Victoria launched a four year road safety plan ‘Towards Zero,’ which hopes to reduce road fatalities by 20% over 5 years. A major focus of this initiative is combating distracted driving, and investing in raising awareness amongst drivers, while also encouraging the use of technology to combat it. This plan, which is spearheaded by several major local branches of government including Vic Police and TAC, plans to spend over a billion dollars improving road safety. 

Providing ClearDrive can present itself as a viable and successful app in reducing road deaths, such initiatives as Towards Zero could prove highly beneficial in a multitude of ways. Firstly, we can pitch to the Victorian Government to invest in our platform, considering their goals align with ours. This would give us a financial infusion needed to both develop ClearDrive further, while continuing our marketing campaign. Secondly, we can appeal for Towards Zero to advertise our app in their own advertising and media. The Towards Zero sites refers how it will ‘trial automated and connected vehicle technology in Victoria’ to reduce road deaths. As such an app, we hope to potentially partner with the Toward Zero initiative to increase our own number of downloads. 

We also hope to increase Clear Drives effectiveness by investing and developing its technological capabilities. Currently, our plan restricts Clear Drives to being used when a user of the app switches it on, on their mobile device. As enabling and then disabling an app every time a person drives can be cumbersome and time consuming, we envision this resulting is less and less use as time goes on after the initial download. 

Our team has developed two potential remedies to this problem. Firstly, incorporating ClearDrive to use GPS, or Smart Phones Magnetometer’s to automatically detect when an individual is driving. When ClearDrive can detect such rapid movement, it would then automatically enable itself, and then disable itself when such movement has stopped or slowed. This would obviously have drawbacks for passengers of cars, or users travelling on trains, trams or busses. The second option addresses this problem, but most likely be harder to develop.

Our second option will not rely on the phone itself to detect movement, but on the Bluetooth function. If we can configure ClearDrive to recognise and enable itself when the mobile device is paired with a nearby car, its function will become automatic. The main drawbacks of this at the moment however, are that not all cars use pairing technology, and not all drivers use the pairing technology of their cars. 

Whatever option we do decide to pursue, our goals for the future are focused on developing ClearDrive by securing more support, and increasing its technological ability.  

#### How we are different 

As awareness around distracted driving increases, and the use of mobile phone technology increases, there has naturally been a range of apps similar to ClearDrive developed. Many of these apps have similar goals and processes to our own, with the aim of stopping distracted driving by limiting phone activity. However, we believe that Clear Drive stands out in a number of different ways from these others apps, both in function, and in accessibility. 

The majority of apps that are aimed to stop distracted driving are targeted towards the parents of teenagers who are looking to protect their child from injury. As such, they market themselves to a smaller demographic, and the features offered are not beneficial to the average driver. Such apps include Canary, an app that while preventing phone use while driving, also notifies the parent if the child exceeds a speed limit, or ventures off an established route. While perhaps useful for specific situations, Canary acts more as a surveillance tracker than a preventative app designed to reduce road accidents. 

Another key difference with ClearDrive, is that it is based around and will be marketed towards Australian users and devices. Many of our competitor apps were built and distributed for US or overseas use, such as CellControl, TextArrest, DriveScribe and Live2Txt. As such, many of these applications are hard to access, download or use overseas to their native country. 

Perhaps our main competing technology, is Perth based company TextStopper, which uses US adapted technology and markets it to Australian companies. TextStopper comes as an identification device and phone based app, that can be attached to each car to hide all notifications bar outgoing hands free calls. According to a 2018 RACV report, TextStopper is being used currently by Red Bull and Coca Cola cars to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving. 

While TextStopper has an established product and user base, ClearDrive when developed will have several important advantages. For installation, TextStopper must be manually installed in each car, and cannot be simply downloaded like ClearDrive. Additionally, TextStopper must be bought and picked up from one of the company’s offices, based only in the ACT. ClearDrive will also be free for download and use for all users, while TextDrive costs an advertised price of $249 for each purchase.

Because of its price and accessibility, it is clear that TextStopper is marketed towards larger companies and businesses. Whereas ClearDrive will be developed for use of all Australian drivers, and free to download.

As our external IT specialist, Sebastian will ensure that when ClearDrive is hosted on other platforms such as the App Store, it is well within Apples Guidelines and there will be no problems. He will oversee step three, which involves working to disseminate the app across multiple platforms. By researching and planning out how this is done, he will ensure ClearDrive faces no issues being uploaded to public platforms to be downloaded. 

## 7.Scope and limits

At this stage it is expected that the design of ClearDrive will occur over five stages. Using the Agile software development approach to develop ClearDrive and feedback received at each of the proposed stages will determine the appropriate changes will determine the priority of the next stages. Agile allows the development of the software to go through adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. Further stages and features can be added to the Apps as updates. The minimum viable product is the first stage and is an app with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. The stages are:

  1.	Focusing ClearDrive on one platform, being Apple’s iOS and having a simple App that can turn off all phone notifications in one touch which will need to be activated by a ClearDrive user before they commence driving. The ClearDrive user can also create a simple message reply that can be automatically set to respond to messages. For example, the automatic message reply can state, ‘I am currently driving and will get back to you shortly’. The ClearDrive user can readily reactivate the notifications with two number PIN. Two numbers were selected as it is less likely (compared to one touch activation) to accidently turn on and distract the driver and is quick and easy to turn back on. The benefits of this are that the user can deactivate all notifications in one touch rather than going to settings and they can quickly reactivate the notifications at the end of the journey. They can also easily set up an automatic message reply for when notifications are turned off. 
  
  2.	Still on the iOS platform, ClearDrive will add GPS functionality where the ClearDrive user can set the App to automatically turn off notifications and enable automatic messaging replies once the speed is detected to go over 30km/h. ClearDrive will turn on notifications and turn off automatic messages once a speed of less than 10km/h is sustained for more than five consecutive minutes. This prevents ClearDrive from activating whilst stationary in lights or traffic and 10km/h is considered higher than normal walking pace so will mimic a person walking away from their parked car. 
  
  3.	The third stage is still on the iOS platform, ClearDrive will also add maps so that it can differentiate between a person in a car and a person using public transport. Where ClearDrive detects that the device is travelling along a public transport corridor it will automatically disengage and allow notifications through. It is proposed that it will do this by detecting if the device is travelling along a train line or following a bus or tram line for more than four kilometres. Alternatively, as stated in the first stage ClearDrive user can override ClearDrive and turn on notifications by simply entering the two number PIN.
  
  4.	The fourth stage is still on the iOS platform and ClearDrive will use Bluetooth to communicate with the vehicle and know which device to turn off the notifications as it is likely (but not always which is why the above stages have been proposed) to be the driver’s device which is the reason that we want to limit distractions. The App requires the App user to set up their vehicle’s Bluetooth system through it on initial pairing. ClearDrive can then be set up to vary the level of notifications that come through the vehicle’s Bluetooth system for example all messaging notifications can be blocked but calls can be let through. Also, once the device is paired to vehicle it will activate ClearDrive and deactivate it once the Bluetooth signal is turned off by the vehicle turning off. 
  
  5.	The fifth stage, is to implement ClearDrive on the Android platform. This proposed to be done by incorporating each of the four stages above or any other stage identified and implemented by the Agile process during the development of the iOS App. The preference is to start on the Android platform as the second largest market share in Australia after iOS. 

## 8.Tools and technologies

### iOS

It is envisaged that the iOS App will be developed on Xcode. Although there other ways to create Apps such as Appy Pie or outsourcing development to freelance App developers given the scale of the project being not having has much resources when compared to large companies running their Apps and the constant reiterations required via the Agile model, it is considered developing the iOS App on Xcode will be appropriated. 

Objective-C is the programming language used to create functionality within iPhone apps. It handles data and object manipulation. Objective-C is a derivative of the C family of languages, and is an object-oriented language. Anyone with a basic understanding of C or Java, Objective-C should be, for the most part, understand how to use Objective-C.

Alternatively, we can create the App using the Swift language, the follow-on to Objective-C. Swift has a much friendlier syntax and a more modern feel.

Xcode is available for free from Apple, but requires OS X 10.8 or later to be installed. There is no official way to run Xcode on a Windows or Linux PC. To develop iOS 10 apps, we will need Xcode 11 and the iOS 12 SDK, also available from Apple. While we can code completely within Xcode, it will be easier working with large chunks of code through a dedicated text editor that specialises in programming syntax. TextMate is the version that will likely be used and costs approximately 50 EUR per licence. For custom art and designs for the App, we will need a program that can create vector graphics. Vector graphics scale without losing clarity, and are essential for a good-looking app. DrawBerry is a free vector graphics drawing program. 

For the map at later stages of the App design, it ios expected that we will use Google Maps. However, we will need an application programming interface (API) key which requires a licence and the Maps SDK for iOS. The API key requires Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license. The cost is per usage and averages about $10 USD per 1,000 uses of the App.

Also in order to distribute the App on the App Store we need to sign up for an Apple Developer account which costs $99 per year. 

### Android App

The Android App will be created with Android Studio which is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. Android Studio can be installed on Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome OS devices. Android Studio is free.
The cost for access to Google Maps will be the same as iOS.
To publish the Android App on the Google Play, we will need a developer account which incurs a one time registration fee of $25 USD.

## 9.Testing

As programming of ClearDrive progresses, it will be subject to comprehensive testing at every stage of development from discovery, design, build, launch and development of later versions.

A marketing consultant will be engaged in the discovery phase to help understand our customers, their expectations and how to make them choose ClearDrive. This will identify our target users and their attitudes, likes, dislikes and frustrations they may have had using similar apps.

The findings from the discovery phase will feed into building specifications in the design phase. They will help guide decisions on the best features to include and prioritise development stages. Test users will be engaged through the marketing consultant to provide feedback and validation of Clear Drives design, to ensure it will provide a good user experience. Feedback collected at this stage will be integrated into the design of the prototype to ensure good user experiences.

After the prototype is built it will be extensively tested by Team Winterfell (and their friends, family) and other users from outside the team will be engaged by the consultant from a range of demographics, to test the app. This testing will be to assess the ease of navigation and use, to identify any bugs, performance issues or user experience issues and test Clear Drive on as many devices as possible (including the oldest to newest models). Users will be videoed using the app in real-life situations and feedback on any usability issues or dislikes will be gathered, analysed. 

ClearDrive will also be tested to ensure it is fully accessible and compliant with legislative requirements within operating jurisdictions.  Necessary adjustments will be made to fix any issues identified, which may include tweaking, adding or removing any features.

The research carried out in the early stages of development will be used to help develop a marketing campaign to attract potential customers in the launch phase. 

Feedback and questions to Service and Support will be monitored to ensure that any issues identified when it used more broadly, are quickly addressed. Competitors and trends will also be monitored to identify features that would improve the app and these, where possible, will be included in later iterations to ensure ClearDrive remains the app of choice in a competitive in a market. 

## 10.Timeframe

In order to develop the best mobile app we have invested significant time into mapping out each step of the development of our ClearDrive app in order to identify crucial milestones and interdependencies.

The detailed project Gant Chart maps out our planning and processes, from establishing our team, initial idea and research, planning, identification of specifications, app design, build, testing and deployment, while simultaneously developing a marketing strategy, engaging investors and a deployment partner.

## 11.Risks

### Distracted Driver Risks

To increase the likelihood of success, we have actively identified and engaged with risk to reduce the possibility and consequence of adverse effects and to optimise the available opportunities. During our research phase into the threats to distracted drivers we adopted the bow tie model to identify and assess the threats, preventative controls, the hazard and the consequences if left uncontrolled.

The focus of our app is to introduce a preventative control to remove one of the major driver distractions, mobile phones.

### Drive Clear App Development Risks

To address the risks and protect the financial standing, reputation of Team Winterfell and the interests of investors, we recognise that risk management is everyone’s business, and integral to sound management and good governance of this development.

The ability to effectively engage with risk requires a combination of factors, including a positive risk culture, fit for purpose software, appropriately skilled people, and learning and development opportunities to build skills.

By first identifying the threats, hazards and consequences we have then put in place preventative controls to mitigate the risk strategies to recover controls to further address risks if needed.

We have identified six main risks to the success of our project and the preventative and recovery controls to mitigate or remove the risks.

## 12.Group processes and communications

Due to the geographically dispersed nature of our team, communication was initially the most challenging aspect of this project. Strategies were employed to reach and engage as many team members as possible including the use of Discord, email and posting to our groups discussion page to assign tasks. 

Introducing email meant that document sharing could be better facilitated, and team members were all kept up to date with the latest versions. The four active members of our team agreed to log in to Discord at regular assigned times throughout the week, so that we could discuss the project.

Building the tasks into a Gant Chart in the project plan provided oversight task progress and ensured that none were overlooked, and all had an assigned owner. We aimed to finish the project ahead of time so that we were aware of any tasks that had not been completed, leaving us time to follow up with the assigned team member and complete the tasks if needed.

## 14.Group reflection

The following are reflections from each group member:

* I would have to say that how our group worked together has overall been a positive experience although communications have at times been challenging. I found the diverse backgrounds of my team surprising but have enjoyed the diversity of the group and the benefits that their different experience and skills have brought to developing our project. One thing I have learnt about group work is to have a backup plan in case people do not deliver an agreed task, as happened to us in the 2nd assignment. - Genevieve 

*	I found it enjoyable working in the group. It has been a great experience working with people with different backgrounds, however, the evidence of the success is shown by the outcome of the completed assignment. It has been a challenge communicating as we don’t have an opportunity to interact face to face as we are spread over the country and have different commitments. However, having a forum like Discord has been a great benefit as we can communicate at a time that is suitable for each of us and keep up to date with the progress of the Assignments. - Robert

* The largest issue our team faced in this assignment was communication, working from different backgrounds and states it was hard for our team to come together at the same time and discuss ideas for our project. Overall though this assignment was an improvement on our last one, in that we managed to complete most of the work before the assigned deadline. The greatest experience I will take away from this project is to ensure group communication is prioritised, and to start work at an early date to allow plenty of time for completion. - Tim
