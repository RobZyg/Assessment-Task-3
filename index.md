ENFJ

Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging ENFJs are the benevolent 'pedagogues' of humanity. They have tremendous charisma by which many are drawn into their nurturant tutelage and/or grand schemes. Many ENFJs have tremendous power to manipulate others with their phenomenal interpersonal skills and unique salesmanship. But it's usually not meant as manipulation -- ENFJs generally believe in their dreams, and see themselves as helpers and enablers, which they usually are.

Results of the Myer-Briggs test:
personality type is: Consul
- 76% extraverted
- 61% observant
- 61% feeling
- 61% tactics
- 53% assertive

Results of the Learning styles test:
- Kinesthetic 69
- Visual 51
- Auditory 49

Results of the TypeFinder Personality test
- 63% extraverted
- 51% intuition
- 55% feeling
- 60% judging

Personality code types: ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Provider’

What the results mean to me
The results show that as I tend to be more extraverted where I am energised by engaging with others and generally enjoy interacting with people. I also tend to be more feeling where I value empathy, cooperation and compassion. I also believe that everyone has a responsibility to take care of those around them. I believe that these traits are accurately portrayed. My learning style preference is learning by doing. I agree with that, whilst I believe passive learning such as watching a lecture and reading is important I think that the best way to test what I have learnt is by actually doing it or, where possible, testing the boundaries. For example instead of watching someone programming, which is helpful to understand the principles, actually programming and testing different things is more beneficial to me than watching.

### <a href="https://poddie62.github.io/RMIT/meandit">Tim</a> 

Student ID:S3806967

I was born and grew up in Melbourne. My family lives across Melbourne and are mostly Australian. After finishing highschool I briefly attended Deakin University, studying a bachelor of arts. I deferred from the course after the second semester after realising I wanted to work fulltime rather than study. After working briefly in hospitality, I started working in finance for the National Australian Bank in 2017. Since then I have moved to a different company in a similar customer service role in Superannuation. Recently in May of 2019 I started studying a bachelor of business online with RMIT. When not working or studying, I enjoy playing tennis, reading, playing PC games and socialising. My main interest in IT stems from my childhood and job. Growing up I was always fascinated with how my family’s jobs were adapting based on the IT technology available. At work as well I rely strongly on a number of IT programs and platforms in order to deliver expected customer service and complex information to internal and external stakeholders. While I enjoy using these programs, I do not understand much beyond their surface level. I hope that this course will better educate me on how they function and how I can best use them going forward.

#### Profile

What do the results of the test mean to you?
While some of these test results are surprising, for the most part they mainly reinforce
what I already knew about myself. I have always been more of an introvert, and in
most large social situations have sought to isolate myself.

The Myer-Briggs test I felt was particularly accurate in that it defined many of my
personality traits and creative style. In This test I was ranked as an INFJ -T. The
test’s explanation of me as an advocate and Diplomat also helped me understand
more about myself and some of the things I have thought but struggled to word in the
past. Particularly, in that while I try my best to help others, I can also be sensitive to
others criticisms and thought, and too idealistic. The Myer-Briggs test also classified
me as easy to burn out, and always looking for a cause. These weaknesses identified
by the test resonated with me. In the past I have often avoided or put off routine
duties to focus fully on what I consider are concrete steps towards my goal. This has
led me on multiple occasions to burn out and give up on something I had been trying
to perfect.

The online learning test was the biggest surprise for me. I have never considered my
preferred style of learning, but before taking this test I would have guessed auditory. I
often enjoy listening to books and podcasts, rather than reading or watching lectures.
However the test classed me quite strongly as visual. I am not sure if I fully agree
with this assessment but will seek to identify my best learning strategies in the future
with experience.

The creativity test showed the most expected results, ranking me above average in
creativity. I have often been told growing up that I was quite creative, and this test
confirmed those comments. However, it was interesting to explore the sub categories
of creativity and where most people and myself ranked.

#### Ideal job

Complaints Manager
This position involves handling a large number of complaints that have been escalated beyond the contact centres in which they started. The successful applicant would need to investigate complex cases within a large organisation, often spanning across multiple divisions or departments. They would also have to correspond with the complainants to reach a positive resolution, while also working to adhere to financial and business rules and regulations. Additionally, they would affect long term change by identifying and seeking to change business practises to reduce dissatisfaction in the future. 

### Team profile

The diversity of backgrounds and personality types in this group make for a successful team as we can call on our different strengths to carry out the different tasks and assist other group members where needed. Together we bring together a wealth of experience and diverse knowledge. We have varied learning styles with some predominantly visual and other kinaesthetic learners, with plenty of opportunities to apply both learning styles during this project.

At this stage it is expected that the design of the App will occur over five stages. Using the Agile software development approach to develop the App and feedback received at each of the proposed stages will determine the appropriate changes will determine the priority of the next stages. Agile allows the development of the software to go through adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. Further stages and features can be added to the Apps as updates. The minimum viable product is the first stage and is an app with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. The stages are:
  1.	Focusing on an App on one platform, being Apple’s iOS and having a simple App that can turn off all phone notifications in one touch which will need to be activated by the App user before they commence driving. The App user can also create a simple message reply that can be automatically set to respond to messages. For example, the automatic message reply can state, ‘I am currently driving and will get back to you shortly’.  The App user can readily reactivate the notifications with two number PIN. Two numbers were selected as it is less likely (compared to one touch activation) to accidently turn on and distract the driver and is quick and easy to turn back on. The benefits of this are that the user can deactivate all notifications in one touch rather than going to settings and they can quickly reactivate the notifications at the end of the journey. They can also easily set up an automatic message reply for when notifications are turned off. 
  2.	Still on the iOS platform, the App will add GPS functionality where the App user can set the App to automatically turn off notifications and enable automatic messaging replies once the speed is detected to go over 30km/h. The App will turn on notifications and turn off automatic messages once a speed of less than 10km/h is sustained for more than five consecutive minutes. This prevents the App from activating whilst stationary in lights or traffic and 10km/h is considered higher than normal walking pace so will mimic a person walking away from their parked car. 
  3.	The third stage is still on the iOS platform, the App will also add maps so that it can differentiate between a person in a car and a person using public transport. Where the App detects that the device is travelling along a public transport corridor it will automatically disengage and allow notifications through. It is proposed that it will do this by detecting if the device is travelling along a train line or following a bus or tram line for more than four kilometres. Alternatively, as stated in the first stage the App user can override the App and turn on notifications by simply entering the two number PIN.
  4.	The fourth stage is still on the iOS platform and the App will use Bluetooth to communicate with the vehicle and know which device to turn off the notifications as it is likely (but not always which is why the above stages have been proposed) to be the driver’s device which is the reason that we want to limit distractions. The App requires the App user to set up their vehicle’s Bluetooth system through it on initial pairing. The App can then be set up to vary the level of notifications that come through the vehicle’s Bluetooth system for example all messaging notifications can be blocked but calls can be let through. Also, once the device is paired to vehicle it will activate the App and deactivate it once the Bluetooth signal is turned off by the vehicle turning off. 
  5.	The fifth stage, is to implement the App on the Android platform. This proposed to be done by incorporating each of the four stages above or any other stage identified and implemented by the Agile process during the development of the iOS App. The preference is to start on the Android platform as the second largest market share in Australia after iOS. 


## 8.Tools and technologies

## 9.Testing

As programming of Clear Drive progresses, it will be subject to comprehensive testing at every stage of development from discovery, design, build, launch and development of later versions.

User testing, Bring customers into every step of the dev process, viewed on 16 August 2019, at 
https://www.usertesting.com/platform/mobile-application-testing

A marketing consultant will be engaged in the discovery phase to help understand our customers, their expectations and how to make them choose Clear Drive. This will identify our target users and their attitudes, likes, dislikes and frustrations they may have had using similar apps.

The findings from the discovery phase will feed into building specifications in the design phase. They will help guide decisions on the best features to include and prioritise development stages. Test users will be engaged through the marketing consultant to provide feedback and validation of Clear Drives design, to ensure it will provide a good user experience. Feedback collected at this stage will be integrated into the design of the prototype to ensure good user experiences.

After the prototype is built it will be extensively tested by Team Winterfell (and their friends, family) and other users from outside the team will be engaged by the consultant from a range of demographics, to test the app. This testing will be to assess the ease of navigation and use, to identify any bugs, performance issues or user experience issues and test Clear Drive on as many devices as possible (including the oldest to newest models). Users will be videoed using the app in real-life situations and feedback on any usability issues or dislikes will be gathered, analysed. 

Clear Drive will also be tested to ensure it is fully accessible and compliant with legislative requirements within operating jurisdictions.  Necessary adjustments will be made to fix any issues identified, which may include tweaking, adding or removing any features.

The research carried out in the early stages of development will be used to help develop a marketing campaign to attract potential customers in the launch phase. 

Feedback and questions to Service and Support will be monitored to ensure that any issues identified when it used more broadly, are quickly addressed. Competitors and trends will also be monitored to identify features that would improve the app and these, where possible, will be included in later iterations to ensure Clear Drive remains the app of choice in a competitive in a market. 

## 10.Timeframe

In order to develop the best mobile app we have invested significant time into mapping out each step of the development of our Clear Drive app in order to identify crucial milestones and interdependencies.

The detailed project Gant Chart maps out our planning and processes, from establishing our team, initial idea and research, planning, identification of specifications, app design, build, testing and deployment, while simultaneously developing a marketing strategy, engaging investors and a deployment partner.

## 11.Risks

### Distracted Driver Risks

To increase the likelihood of success, we have actively identified and engaged with risk to reduce the possibility and consequence of adverse effects and to optimise the available opportunities. During our research phase into the threats to distracted drivers we adopted the bow tie model to identify and assess the threats, preventative controls, the hazard and the consequences if left uncontrolled.

The focus of our app is to introduce a preventative control to remove one of the major driver distractions, mobile phones.

### Drive Clear App Development Risks

To address the risks and protect the financial standing, reputation of Team Winterfell and the interests of investors, we recognise that risk management is everyone’s business, and integral to sound management and good governance of this development.

The ability to effectively engage with risk requires a combination of factors, including a positive risk culture, fit for purpose software, appropriately skilled people, and learning and development opportunities to build skills.

By first identifying the threats, hazards and consequences we have then put in place preventative controls to mitigate the risk strategies to recover controls to further address risks if needed.

We have identified six main risks to the success of our project and the preventative and recovery controls to mitigate or remove the risks.

## 12.Group processes and communnications

Due to the geographically dispersed nature of our team, communication was initially the most challenging aspect of this project. Strategies were employed to reach and engage as many team members as possible including the use of Discord, email and posting to our groups discussion page to assign tasks. 

Introducing email meant that document sharing could be better facilitated, and team members were all kept up to date with the latest versions. The four active members of our team agreed to log in to Discord at regular assigned times throughout the week, so that we could discuss the project.

Building the tasks into a Gant Chart in the project plan provided oversight task progress and ensured that none were overlooked, and all had an assigned owner. We aimed to finish the project ahead of time so that we were aware of any tasks that had not been completed, leaving us time to follow up with the assigned team member and complete the tasks if needed.
